## Learnings and Issues
Some of the learnings I'm taking away from this project are:
1. I had an issue with my Models that was causing a Sequelize Database Error. My tables were not being properly created based on the Models I'd set up. Thanks to help from a TA, Sean, I realized that I was passing unecessary sequelize information in my Post and Comment models (such as timestamps and freeTableName). This was the biggest issue I faced with this assignment. If I ever run into a similar Sequelize Database Error, I'll know where to look!
2. Some of the handlebars pages were a little tricky to get right.
3. I definitely still struggle with Authentication, which is something I look forward to learning more about in the future.ion of tasks would have made for a better start.
